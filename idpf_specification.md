# Introduction

This document describes the host Interface, device behavior, setup, and configuration flows of a PCIE network function device. This device can be presented to an OS as a PCIe Physical function (PF) device or a virtual function (VF) device from a NIC or as a completely emulated device in Host SW. An IDPF device is OS and Vendor Agnostic. 

# Context and Motivation

There is a need for standardized Network function devices that can support high throughput over Ethernet and RDMA. The Goal is to define a multi-vendor interface that takes away most of the CPU cost of an emulated Interface and is inherently extensible and scalable. A useful device must:

* Support easy maintenance to bring down Datacenter operating cost using standardized interfaces.
* Support zero downtime for Tenants while Datacenter operator brings down servers for maintenance
* Support getting more value out of a server by reducing CPU overhead costs on the server 
* Support providing very high  throughput and multiple offload features to the Tenant to keep up with higher demands 
* Provide Flexibility and extensibility to support multi-vendor and per-need negotiable feature sets 
* Be O/S agnostic 
* Be usable in both Virtualized and Bare-metal scenarios

None of the standard interfaces available in the market provide for all these needs. This Spec is an effort towards achieving all the above goals.

# Key Concepts

## IDPF Network Function Device (“Device”)

This is an abstraction of a physical or emulated Network PCIE Device as seen by the driver. It is modeled as having internally a **data path** component that carries out Packet handling and a **control plane** component that is used to configure and monitor the operations of the data-path.  An IDPF Device has the same interface whether used as a Physical Function (PF) PCIe device, a Virtual Function (VF) device (when virtualization is used) , or a composed PCIe entity. It is also Operating-system agnostic, and does not impose assumptions on the implementation of conformant Devices.
